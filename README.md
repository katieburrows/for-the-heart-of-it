A group project that helps users find nearby volunteer opportunities.  The user enters their zip code which is used to pull opportunities from the Meetup API and put them in a table below the zip code input box.  Once a user selects their choice a modal pops up that contains the address, a map, and a link to sign up for the event.  The user can also signup for emails.  The data received from this is sent to a Firebase Database.
